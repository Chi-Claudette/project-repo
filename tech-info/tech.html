	<h1 > Welcome to Tech Info</h1>
	<span>A place for tech related information </span>
</div>
</div>
	<p >We provide detailed information about computers and computer related terms, and technology as a awhole. We make sure everyone is up to date with the latest technological terms.</p>
	<p>You can find all tech related topics here, we are at your service.</p>

	<p>Check out our list of topics at the side.</p>

	<img src="timage.jpg" height="300px" width="600px">
	<p>Let's  start with some brief  introduction to technology. According to Google trends, technology has really grown in popularity since the 1950s. It originates from the Greek for art or  craft, <i>"teckne"</i>, and <i>"logia"</i> relating to study. Together these words became <i><b>technologia </b></i> meaning the systematic treatmeant. </p>
	<p>Techonology is the application of scientific kwnoledge for practical purposes, especially in industry. So normally, whenever we use our scientific kwnoledge to achieve some specific purpose, we are using technology. Technology usaually involves a specific piece of equipment, but that equipment can be very simple or too complex. It can be anything from the discovery of atoms, all the way up to computers and airplaes.</p>
	<h2>Types of technology</h2>
	<p>Since technology can be so simple or very complex,there are many types of technology; </p>
	<h3>1. Communication Technology</h3>
	<img src="com.jpg" height="300px" width="500px">
	<p> This is one of the most common  types of technology, since we live and use it everyday. We use it in our day to day life, even in our work place. This includes mobile devices, landlines and office phones. Advancement in technology has enhanced the ways to communicate information from one place to another. It helps us to communicate with each other with more convenience, in less time, and with greater accuracy.</p>
	<h3>2. Entertainment Technology</h3>
	<img src="enter.jpg" height="300px" width="500px">
	<p>We all want to relax at the end of a long and stressfull day, so this is where entertainment technology comes in. This is where we have our movies  and games. This type of technology is made for leisure purposes. </p>
	<h3>3. Medical Technology</h3>
	<img src="medical.jpg" height="300px" width="500px">
	<p>This type  of technology is used  in hospitals and clinic, specifically created to treat and sustain human life. This is one area of technology that is highly influenced by innovation. It comprises areas like pharmaceuticals and biotechnology to utilize the best possible medical equipment for researching, diagnosing and treating diseases and infections. From small innovations like ankle braces and bandages to advanced technologies like artificial organs and MRI machine, technology has indeed made an unbelievable impact on the field of medicine.</p>
	<h3>4. Educational Technology</h3>
	<img src="education.jpg" height="300px" width="500px">
	<p>It would have been impossible to get to all the above mentioned if we did not start with education first. This type of technology aims at enhancing and easing the performance of students.  This will be done by establishing different technological resources like learning management software and processes in the classroom. It assists the students in learning ways of devising solutions to problems with the help of research, utilization of information, evaluation, and design.</p>
	<h3>5. Product Technology</h3>
	<img src="product.jpg" height="300px" width="500px">
	<p>Product technology understands the process that is taken to create products for the market. This will obviously include the manufacturing process. This type of technology is specific and is used by the manufacturer of the service. As they will know the manpower, standards, and the materials that will be needed. Slot machines, banking apps and e-commerce apps fall under this technology. It helps in determining the functional characteristics, properties, and structure of the product to ensure it meets the requirements and needs of the customer.</p>
	<h3>6. Construction Technology</h3>
	<img src="construction.jpg" height="300px" width="500px">
	<P>Construction technology is related to the equipment that we use to build buildings. This will include engineering structures like bridges, roads. And it will also include construction tools like tractors for land preparation and computer software to design and create a virtual structure of the building. These construction tools help in enhancing the operational efficiency and ensuring that the builders complete the project with minimum issues and accidents, within the specified budget and within the given deadline.</P>
	<h3>7. Information Technology</h3>
	<img src="info.jpg" height="300px" width="500px">
	<p>This technology comprises a set of software and hardware tools utilized to process, transfer and store information. These tools of information technology provide the right individuals with accurate and updated information at the right time.
	Information technology also includes MIS (Management Information Systems), which helps to plan the usage, management, and development of information technology tools to assist workers in performing tasks associated with management and processing. Major financial institutions like banks utilize information technology for operating their business process and to provide high-quality customer service.</p>
	<h3>8. Artificial Intelligence</h3>
	<img src="ai.jpg" height="300px" width="500px">
	<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is also called machine intelligence. 
	It is the intelligence the machines demonstrate, contrasting to the natural intelligence demonstrated by animals and humans. According to computer science, artificial intelligence research is known as intelligent agents study. 
A device perceiving its environment and taking action which maximizes its chances of attaining its goals successfully can be referred to as artificial intelligence. The core element of artificial intelligence is knowledge engineering. 
Machines can react and act like humans when they have sufficient information about the world. Artificial intelligence needs to have access to properties, categories, objects, and relations among them for implementing knowledge engineering.</p>
